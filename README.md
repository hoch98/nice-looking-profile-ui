# nice looking ui

it should work out of the box with `npm run dev` (it did on my local computer at least)

I made this as part of a social media site project I was a part of

i removed the unrelated parts like the auth (which I also worked on) and sidebar (just in case the dev who made it doesn't want it posted publicly)

but it may still have residuals from the project in the form of unnecessary/unused dependencies

I used a mix of mui material and mui joy, cus mui joy components just look really nice, but also lack some of the features (or documentation) some mui mat components had
